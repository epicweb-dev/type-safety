# Exact Values

👨‍💼 TypeScript now catches invalid values at compile time!

🦉 This is much better than runtime validation:

- Errors appear in your IDE as you type
- No runtime checks needed
- Self-documenting—the type shows allowed values
- Autocomplete suggests valid options

## Value-first with `as const`

The `as const` pattern derives types from runtime values:

```ts
const sizes = ['xs', 's', 'm', 'l', 'xl'] as const
type Size = (typeof sizes)[number] // 'xs' | 's' | 'm' | 'l' | 'xl'
```

This approach is powerful because:

- The array is available at runtime for iteration and validation
- Types and values stay in sync automatically
- Less duplication between runtime and type-level code
- You can use `sizes.includes(userInput)` for runtime validation
