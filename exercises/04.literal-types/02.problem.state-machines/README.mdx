# State Machines

👨‍💼 Literal types are perfect for modeling state machines. A state machine has
defined states and transitions between them.

```ts
type TrafficLight = 'red' | 'yellow' | 'green'
```

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Create a state machine for an order (pending → processing → shipped →
   delivered)
2. Create **pure transition functions** that take current state and return new
   state
3. Create a state machine for a simple media player

💰 State transition as a **pure function** (takes state in, returns new state
out):

```ts
function nextState(current: OrderState): OrderState {
	switch (current) {
		case 'pending':
			return 'processing'
		// ...
	}
}
```

Notice this function doesn't mutate anything—it returns a new state. This is the
functional approach to state management.
