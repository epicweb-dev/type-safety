# State Machines

👨‍💼 Literal types are perfect for modeling state machines. A state machine has
defined states and transitions between them.

```ts
type TrafficLight = 'red' | 'yellow' | 'green'
```

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Create a state machine for an order (pending → processing → shipped →
   delivered)
2. Create transition functions that only allow valid transitions
3. Create a state machine for a simple media player

💰 State transition function:

```ts
function nextState(current: OrderState): OrderState {
	switch (current) {
		case 'pending':
			return 'processing'
		// ...
	}
}
```
