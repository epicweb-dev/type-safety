# State Machines

👨‍💼 You've built type-safe state machines!

🦉 The beauty of this approach:

- Only valid states can exist
- Transitions are explicit and type-checked
- Adding a new state? TypeScript ensures you handle it everywhere
- Documentation is built into the types

State machines are used everywhere: UI flows, order processing, game logic,
network connections, and more.
