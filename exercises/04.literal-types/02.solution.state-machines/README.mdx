# State Machines

👨‍💼 You've built type-safe state machines using pure functions!

🦉 The beauty of this approach:

- Only valid states can exist
- Transitions are **pure functions** (state in → state out)
- No mutation—each transition returns a new state value
- Adding a new state? TypeScript ensures you handle it everywhere
- Documentation is built into the types

	This pattern—pure functions that transform state—is exactly how React's
	`useReducer` and Redux work. The reducer is just a state machine transition
	function: `(state, action) => newState`. You're learning the foundation of
	modern UI state management!

State machines are used everywhere: UI flows, order processing, game logic,
network connections, and more.
