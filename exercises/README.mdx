# Type Safety 🛡️

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/type-safety/introduction-to-type-safety/intro-to-type-safety" />

👨‍💼 Welcome to the Type Safety workshop! This is where TypeScript becomes
**meaningfully different** from JavaScript.

In this workshop, we'll explore **how to make illegal states unrepresentable**.
That means designing types so that invalid data simply cannot exist in your
program.

We'll cover:

1. **Type Aliases** - Naming and reusing complex types
2. **Union Types** - Modeling multiple possibilities
3. **Literal Types** - Working with exact values
4. **Intersection Types** - Combining behaviors
5. **Any vs Unknown** - Escape hatches and safe refinement
6. **Generics** - Creating reusable type-safe functions and types
7. **Interfaces** - Defining object shapes with contracts
8. **Enums** - Using named constants and comparing enums with unions

	This workshop transforms how you think about types. Instead of types being an
	afterthought, they become a design tool for writing correct code.
</callout-info>

By the end of this workshop, you'll be able to:

- Create reusable type aliases and interfaces
- Use literal types for exact value constraints
- Model complex domains with union and intersection types
- Handle unknown data safely
- Create flexible, reusable code with generics
- Design types that prevent bugs by construction
- Choose between enums and union types

Let's make your types work for you! 🔒
