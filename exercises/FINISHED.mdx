# Type Safety

👨‍💼 Congratulations! You've completed the Type Safety workshop! 🎉

You now have powerful tools for modeling your domain:

- **Type aliases** give names to complex types
- **Interfaces** define contracts for objects
- **Union types** model "one of these options"
- **Literal types** specify exact values
- **Intersection types** combine requirements
- **Unknown** is the safe alternative to `any`

📝 Reflect on what you learned:

- How can you use union types to make invalid states impossible?
- When would you choose an interface over a type alias?
- How will you handle unknown data from external sources?

🦉 **Key insight**: The best type systems don't just catch errors—they make
errors impossible to write. When you design types that represent only valid
states, bugs become structurally impossible.

## What's Next?

In the next workshop, **Object-Oriented Programming in TypeScript**, you'll
learn about classes, inheritance, and polymorphism. The type techniques you
learned here will make OOP patterns more powerful.

Keep typing! ⌨️
