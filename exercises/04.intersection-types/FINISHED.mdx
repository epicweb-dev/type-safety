# Intersection Types

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/type-safety/4-intersection-types/break-intersection-types" />

👨‍💼 You've learned to combine types with intersections!

You learned:

- ➕ **`&` operator** combines types
- 🧩 **Composing types** from building blocks
- 🆚 **Intersection vs extension** - similar but different
- 💡 **Flexibility** - works with type aliases, not just interfaces

🦉 Intersections vs extends:

```ts
// Using intersection
type User = BaseEntity & { name: string }

// Using interface extends
interface User extends BaseEntity {
	name: string
}
```

Both work. Intersections are more flexible (work with unions, type aliases),
while `extends` is more explicit about the hierarchy.

Next up: `any` vs `unknown`—handling uncertain types safely!
