# Combining Types

👨‍💼 Beautiful type composition! The base types are reused across all entities.

🦉 This pattern is extremely common in real applications:

- Database entities share ID and timestamp fields
- API responses share metadata fields
- UI components share common props

Intersections let you define these once and compose them everywhere.
