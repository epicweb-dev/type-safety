# Enums

👨‍💼 Well done! You understand both enums and their alternatives.

You learned:

- 📝 **String enums** for readable, predictable values
- 🔢 **Numeric enums** for auto-incrementing numbers
- 🔀 **Union types** as a lighter-weight alternative
- ⚖️ **Tradeoffs** between enums and unions

🦉 The TypeScript community—especially in functional and React codebases—prefers
union types:

```ts
// Modern TypeScript style (functional approach)
type Status = 'pending' | 'active' | 'completed'
type HttpMethod = 'GET' | 'POST' | 'PUT' | 'DELETE'
```

Union types work beautifully with TypeScript's type narrowing. When you write
`if (status === 'pending')`, TypeScript knows exactly which type you're working
with.

But enums still have their place, especially when:

- You need reverse mapping (number to name)
- Your team prefers the enum pattern
- You're working with existing enum-heavy codebases

🎉 Congratulations! You've completed the Type Safety workshop! You can now
design types that make invalid states unrepresentable and choose between enums
and unions when modeling fixed sets of values.
