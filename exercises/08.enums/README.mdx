# Enums

Enums give names to sets of related values. Instead of using magic strings or
numbers, you use meaningful identifiers.

```ts
enum Status {
	Pending = 'pending',
	Active = 'active',
	Completed = 'completed',
}

const orderStatus: Status = Status.Active
```

## String Enums vs Numeric Enums

```ts
// String enum - values are strings
enum Color {
	Red = 'red',
	Green = 'green',
	Blue = 'blue',
}

// Numeric enum - values are numbers (auto-incremented)
enum Direction {
	Up, // 0
	Down, // 1
	Left, // 2
	Right, // 3
}
```

## Enums vs Union Types

TypeScript offers an alternative: **union types** of string literals.

```ts
// Enum
enum Status {
	Pending = 'pending',
	Active = 'active',
}

// Union type alternative
type Status = 'pending' | 'active'
```

Many TypeScript developers prefer union types because:

- Simpler syntax
- No runtime overhead
- Better tree-shaking
- Works with string literals directly

<callout-info>
	In functional programming, union types are the standard way to represent a
	fixed set of possibilities. They work seamlessly with TypeScript's type
	narrowing and discriminated unions—patterns you'll use extensively in modern
	React and other functional codebases.
</callout-info>

Choose enums when you need reverse mapping (number → name) or when working with
teams that prefer the enum syntax. Otherwise, union types are often the better
choice.

In this exercise, you'll work with both enums and union types.
