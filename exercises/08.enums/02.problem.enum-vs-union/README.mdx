# Enum vs Union Types

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/type-safety/8-enums/enum-vs-union" />

👨‍💼 You've already created enums. Now let's migrate them to union types which is
the preferred approach in modern TypeScript.

The code already has an enum-based logging function. Your task is to create a
union-based version.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Create a new function `logWithUnion` that uses an inline union type instead
   of the `LogLevel` enum
2. The union type should be: `'debug' | 'info' | 'warn' | 'error'`
3. Export both functions so we can compare them

	If you see an "experimental transform-types" warning when running this step,
	that's from the workshop runtime and can be ignored.
