# Type Guards (Predicate Functions)

👨‍💼 Excellent! You've created custom type guards!

🦉 Type guards are **predicate functions**—pure functions that test a condition
and return a boolean. They're powerful because:

- They work with the `unknown` type safely
- They tell TypeScript exactly what type to expect
- They can validate complex shapes
- They're reusable and composable across your codebase

	Type guards follow the functional pattern: they're pure functions with no side
	effects. You can combine them, pass them around, and test them in isolation.
	This makes validation logic easy to reason about and maintain.

This pattern is essential for:

- API response validation
- Form input validation
- Data from external sources
- Runtime type checking when needed
