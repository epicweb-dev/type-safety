# Escape Hatches

👨‍💼 Sometimes you need to work with data whose type you don't know. Let's see
how `any` and `unknown` differ.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. See how `any` allows anything (dangerous!)
2. See how `unknown` requires checks (safe!)
3. Refactor `any` code to use `unknown`

<callout-info>
	`JSON.parse(str)` converts a JSON string into a JavaScript value. TypeScript
	types this as `any` by default, which is why returning `unknown` is safer—it
	forces callers to narrow the type before using it.
</callout-info>

<callout-info>
	This exercise introduces **type guard functions** with the `value is Type`
	return type syntax. This is a preview—we'll cover type guards in more depth in
	the next exercise. For now, just know that this special syntax tells
	TypeScript "if this function returns true, narrow the type."
