# Escape Hatches

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/type-safety/5-any-vs-unknown/escape-hatches" />

👨‍💼 Sometimes you need to work with data whose type you don't know. Let's see

1. See how `any` allows anything (dangerous!)
2. See how `unknown` requires checks (safe!)
3. Refactor `any` code to use `unknown`
