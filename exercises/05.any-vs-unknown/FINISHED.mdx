# Any vs Unknown

👨‍💼 You understand the difference between `any` and `unknown`!

You learned:

- 🚨 **`any`** disables type checking—dangerous!
- 🛡️ **`unknown`** requires narrowing—safe!
- 🔍 **Type guards** verify types at runtime
- ✅ **Best practice**: Use `unknown` for external data

🦉 When you encounter `any` in code, ask:

- Can this be `unknown` instead?
- What type should this actually be?
- Is there a more specific type available?

Every `any` is a potential bug waiting to happen. Prefer `unknown` and narrow
it properly.

🎉 Congratulations! You've completed the Type Safety workshop. You can now
design types that make illegal states unrepresentable!
