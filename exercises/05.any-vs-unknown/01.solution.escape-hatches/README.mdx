# Escape Hatches

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/type-safety/5-any-vs-unknown/escape-hatches" />

👨‍💼 You've seen the danger of `any` and the safety of `unknown`!

🦉 The key difference:

- `any` trusts you completely (even when you're wrong)
- `unknown` requires proof before allowing operations

This is why `unknown` should be your default for external data: API responses,
user input, file contents, etc.
