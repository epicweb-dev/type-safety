# Any vs Unknown

TypeScript has two types for "I don't know what this is": `any` and `unknown`.
They behave very differently.

## The `any` Type

`any` disables type checking entirely. You can do anything with `any`:

```ts
let value: any = 'hello'
value.foo.bar.baz() // No error! (but will crash at runtime)
value = 42
value.toUpperCase() // No error! (but will crash at runtime)
```

<callout-danger>
	`any` is an escape hatch that removes type safety. Use it sparingly, if at
	all.
</callout-danger>

## The `unknown` Type

`unknown` is the type-safe version. You must narrow it before use:

```ts
let value: unknown = 'hello'
value.toUpperCase() // ❌ Error: Object is of type 'unknown'

if (typeof value === 'string') {
	value.toUpperCase() // ✅ Now TypeScript knows it's a string
}
```

## When to Use Each

| Scenario            | Use       |
| ------------------- | --------- |
| External data       | `unknown` |
| Migrating JS to TS  | `any`     |
| Third-party library | `any`     |
| JSON.parse result   | `unknown` |
| User input          | `unknown` |

<callout-info>
	Prefer `unknown` over `any`. It forces you to verify the type before using the
	value, catching potential bugs.
</callout-info>

In this exercise, you'll compare `any` and `unknown` and practice refactoring
escape hatches into safer checks.
