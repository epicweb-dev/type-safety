# Narrowing

👨‍💼 Great narrowing! TypeScript follows your checks and knows the specific type
in each branch.

🦉 The `type` property pattern (discriminated unions) is especially powerful
because:

- TypeScript narrows the entire object
- Switch statements work perfectly
- Exhaustiveness checking is automatic
