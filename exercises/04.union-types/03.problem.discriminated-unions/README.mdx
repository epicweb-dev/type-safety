# Discriminated Unions

👨‍💼 Discriminated unions (also called "tagged unions" or "algebraic data types")
are a pattern where each type in a union has a common "discriminant" property
with a literal type value.

```ts
type Circle = { kind: 'circle'; radius: number }
type Rectangle = { kind: 'rectangle'; width: number; height: number }
type Shape = Circle | Rectangle
```

The `kind` property lets TypeScript narrow the type automatically. This is how
you **make invalid states unrepresentable**—the type system ensures you can only
create valid combinations.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Create discriminated unions for API responses
2. Create discriminated unions for payment methods
3. Handle all cases with exhaustiveness checking

💰 Use a `never` check in the default case to ensure all cases are handled.
