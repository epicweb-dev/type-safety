# Discriminated Unions

👨‍💼 Discriminated unions (also called "tagged unions" or "algebraic data types")
are a pattern where each type in a union has a common "discriminant" property
with a literal type value.

```ts
type Circle = { kind: 'circle'; radius: number }
type Rectangle = { kind: 'rectangle'; width: number; height: number }
type Shape = Circle | Rectangle
```

The `kind` property lets TypeScript narrow the type automatically. This is how
you **make invalid states unrepresentable**—the type system ensures you can only
create valid combinations.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Create discriminated unions for API responses
2. Create discriminated unions for payment methods
3. Handle all cases with exhaustiveness checking

💰 Exhaustiveness checking with `never`:

```ts
function handle(shape: Shape) {
	switch (shape.kind) {
		case 'circle':
			return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2
		case 'rectangle':
			return shape.width * shape.height
		default: {
			// If you add a new shape and forget to handle it,
			// TypeScript will error here!
			const _exhaustive: never = shape
			return _exhaustive
		}
	}
}
```
