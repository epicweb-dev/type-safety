# Type Guards

👨‍💼 Excellent! You've created custom type guards!

🦉 Type guards are powerful because:

- They work with the `unknown` type safely
- They tell TypeScript exactly what type to expect
- They can validate complex shapes
- They're reusable across your codebase

This pattern is essential for:

- API response validation
- Form input validation
- Data from external sources
- Runtime type checking when needed
