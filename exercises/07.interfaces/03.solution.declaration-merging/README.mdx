# Declaration Merging

👨‍💼 Declaration merging is complete! Each interface declaration added new
properties, and TypeScript combined them all.

🦉 This feature is especially useful for:

- **Extending library types** - Add properties to third-party interfaces
- **Plugin systems** - Each plugin can augment a shared config interface
- **Global augmentation** - Add properties to `Window` or other globals

This is the one capability that interfaces have that type aliases don't!

<callout-warning>

Declaration merging is powerful but **dangerous for everyday types**. Any code
anywhere can secretly add properties to your interface—making it hard to know
what a type actually contains without searching your entire codebase.

This is why many teams prefer **type aliases for application code** (they can't
be merged) and reserve interfaces for library APIs that genuinely need
extension.
