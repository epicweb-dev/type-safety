# Declaration Merging

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/type-safety/7-interfaces/declaration-merging/solution" />

👨‍💼 Declaration merging is complete! The `Config` interface was declared in the
global scope in `index.ts` with `appName`, then augmented in `config-augment.ts`
with `theme` and `maxConnections` using `declare global`. When you import both
files, TypeScript merges all the global `Config` declarations together!

This is why `config` can have properties from both files—TypeScript sees all
the `declare global { interface Config { ... } }` blocks and combines them into
a single merged interface.

🦉 This feature is especially useful for:

- **Extending library types** - Add properties to third-party interfaces
- **Plugin systems** - Each plugin can augment a shared config interface in its
  own file
- **Global augmentation** - Add properties to `Window` or other globals
- **Modular configuration** - Split interface definitions across multiple files

This is the one capability that interfaces have that type aliases don't!

<callout-warning>

Declaration merging is powerful but **dangerous for everyday types**. Any code
anywhere can secretly add properties to your interface—making it hard to know
what a type actually contains without searching your entire codebase.

This is why many teams prefer **type aliases for application code** (they can't
be merged) and reserve interfaces for library APIs that genuinely need
extension.
