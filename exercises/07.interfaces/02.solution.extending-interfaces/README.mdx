# Extending Interfaces

👨‍💼 Beautiful! Interface extension keeps your types DRY.

🦉 When to use extends vs intersection (`&`):

- **`extends`** - Clear hierarchy, works with interfaces
- **`&`** - Ad-hoc combinations, works with any types

Both achieve similar results, but `extends` is more explicit about the
relationship.
