# Extending Interfaces

👨‍💼 Beautiful! Interface extension keeps your types DRY.

Interestingly, you can use intersections with interfaces as well:

```ts
type AuditLog = Timestamps & {
	action: string
	userId: string
}
```

🦉 When to use extends vs intersection (`&`):

- **`extends`** - Clear hierarchy, works with interfaces
- **`&`** - Ad-hoc combinations, works with any types

Both achieve similar results, but because `&` works with both, it's recommended.
