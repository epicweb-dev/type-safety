# Discriminated Unions

👨‍💼 Perfect implementation of discriminated unions!

🦉 This pattern—defining all possible states and using exhaustive `switch`
statements—is fundamental to functional programming. It's exactly how React,
Redux, and many modern libraries handle state.

This pattern is extremely common in real applications:

- **API states** (loading, success, error)
- **Form states** (idle, submitting, submitted, error)
- **Authentication** (anonymous, authenticated, loading)
- **Payment methods** (card, PayPal, crypto)

The exhaustiveness check with `never` ensures you can't forget to handle a case
when you add a new variant. TypeScript becomes your safety net!

	Notice how each function here is a **pure transformation**: it takes a state,
	inspects it, and returns a result without side effects. This is the functional
	pattern—data flows through functions, types guide your logic.
