# Multiple Types

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/type-safety/2-union-types/multiple-types/solution" />

👨‍💼 You've handled values that can be different types!

🦉 Notice the narrowing techniques:

- `typeof` for primitives (string, number, boolean)
- `instanceof` for class instances (Error, Date)
- Property checks for objects

TypeScript tracks what you've checked and narrows the type accordingly.
