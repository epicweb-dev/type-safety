# Union Types

👨‍💼 You've mastered union types and narrowing!

You learned:

- 🔀 **Union types** model "one of these types"
- 🔍 **Narrowing** with `typeof`, `in`, and type guards
- 🏷️ **Discriminated unions** (algebraic data types) with tag properties
- ✅ **Exhaustiveness checking** to handle all cases

🦉 Discriminated unions are a core functional programming pattern:

```ts
type ApiResponse =
	| { status: 'loading' }
	| { status: 'success'; data: User[] }
	| { status: 'error'; error: string }

// The type defines EXACTLY which states are possible.
// No "loading with an error", no "success without data".
// Invalid states are unrepresentable!
```

This pattern—making impossible states impossible—is used extensively in React,
Redux, and functional programming in general. It's how you let the type system
catch bugs before they happen.
