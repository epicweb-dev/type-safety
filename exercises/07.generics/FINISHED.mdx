# Generics

👨‍💼 Excellent work with generics! This is one of the most important TypeScript
skills.

You learned:

- 📦 **Generic functions** work with any type while preserving safety
- 🏷️ **Generic types** create reusable type templates
- 🔒 **Constraints** limit what types can be used
- 🔢 **Multiple type parameters** for complex relationships

🦉 Generics appear everywhere in real codebases:

```ts
// React hooks
const [state, setState] = useState<User>(initialUser)

// API responses
async function fetchData<T>(url: string): Promise<T> { ... }

// Data structures
const map = new Map<string, User>()

// Event handlers
function on<K extends keyof Events>(event: K, handler: Events[K]) { ... }
```

Once you understand generics, you'll see them everywhere—and you'll write much
more flexible, reusable TypeScript code.

<callout-info>
	Generics are how functional programming achieves code reuse. Instead of
	inheritance hierarchies, you write generic functions that work with any type
	meeting certain constraints. This is why modern codebases favor
	**functions + generics** over **classes + inheritance**.

🎉 Congratulations! You've completed the Type Safety workshop! You now have the
tools to make invalid states unrepresentable and write type-safe transformations
using discriminated unions, type guards, and generics.
