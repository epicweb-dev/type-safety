# Naming Types

👨‍💼 Much cleaner! Now the types are defined once and used everywhere.

🦉 Benefits you get immediately:

- Change the type in one place, it updates everywhere
- Function parameters are self-documenting
- IDE autocomplete knows the shape
- Typos in property names are caught

Type aliases are one of the first things you should add when you notice
yourself repeating the same object structure.
