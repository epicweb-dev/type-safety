# Naming Types

👨‍💼 Much cleaner! Now the types are defined once and used everywhere.

🦉 Benefits you get immediately:

- Change the type in one place, it updates everywhere
- Function parameters are self-documenting
- IDE autocomplete knows the shape
- Typos in property names are caught

Type aliases are one of the first things you should add when you notice
yourself repeating the same object structure.

## Alternative: deriving types from values

When you have a canonical example value, you can derive the type from it:

```ts
const defaultUser = {
	id: '',
	name: '',
	email: '',
} as const

type User = typeof defaultUser
```

This keeps the type and the default value in sync automatically. It's especially
useful for configuration objects and form defaults.
