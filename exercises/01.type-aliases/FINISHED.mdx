# Type Aliases

👨‍💼 Excellent! You now know how to create reusable type aliases.

You learned:

- 📛 **Naming types** makes code self-documenting
- ♻️ **Reusing types** eliminates repetition
- 🧩 **Composing types** builds complex from simple
- 📚 **Any type** can have an alias, not just objects

🦉 A common pattern is to create a "types" file for shared types:

```ts
// types.ts
export type User = { ... }
export type Product = { ... }
export type Order = { ... }
```

This keeps types organized and easy to import where needed.
