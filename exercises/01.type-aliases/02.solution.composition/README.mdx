# Type Composition

👨‍💼 You've built a type hierarchy from simple building blocks!

🦉 This composition approach has benefits:

- **Consistency** - All IDs have the same type
- **Flexibility** - Change `ID` from `string` to `number` in one place
- **Documentation** - Types like `Email` communicate intent

In the next exercise on intersection types, you'll learn an even cleaner way to
compose types without repeating fields.
