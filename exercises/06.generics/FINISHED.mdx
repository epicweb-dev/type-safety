# Generics

👨‍💼 Excellent work with generics! This is one of the most important TypeScript
skills.

You learned:

- 📦 **Generic functions** work with any type while preserving safety
- 🏷️ **Generic types** create reusable type templates
- 🔒 **Constraints** limit what types can be used
- 🔢 **Multiple type parameters** for complex relationships

🦉 Generics appear everywhere in real codebases:

```ts
// React hooks
const [state, setState] = useState<User>(initialUser)

// API responses
async function fetchData<ResponseBody>(url: string): Promise<ResponseBody> { ... }

// Data structures
const map = new Map<string, User>()

// Event handlers
function on<EventName extends keyof Events>(
	event: EventName,
	handler: Events[EventName],
) { ... }
```

Once you understand generics, you'll see them everywhere—and you'll write much
more flexible, reusable TypeScript code.

<callout-info>
	Generics are how functional programming achieves code reuse. Instead of
	inheritance hierarchies, you write generic functions that work with any type
	meeting certain constraints. This is why modern codebases favor **functions +
	generics** over **classes + inheritance**.
