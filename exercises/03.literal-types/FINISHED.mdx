# Literal Types

👨‍💼 Nice work! You used literal types to model exact values and `as const` to
preserve them in arrays and objects.

Key takeaways:

- Literal types let you encode specific values as types
- `as const` prevents widening and preserves exact values
- Config objects can become the source of truth for derived types
