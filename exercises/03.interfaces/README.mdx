# Interfaces

Interfaces are another way to define object shapes in TypeScript. They're
similar to type aliases for objects, but with some key differences.

```ts
interface User {
	name: string
	email: string
}

const user: User = { name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@example.com' }
```

## Interface vs Type Alias

Both can define object shapes:

```ts
// Type alias
type User = { name: string; email: string }

// Interface
interface User {
	name: string
	email: string
}
```

Key differences:

| Feature              | Type Alias | Interface      |
| -------------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| Object shapes        | ✅         | ✅             |
| Union types          | ✅         | ❌             |
| Declaration merging  | ❌         | ✅             |
| Extends keyword      | Use `&`    | `extends`      |
| Class implementation | ✅         | ✅ (preferred) |

## When to Use Interfaces

- **Object shapes** that may be extended
- **Class contracts** (implements)
- **Library APIs** that users might extend
- **When you prefer the `extends` syntax**

<callout-info>
	Many teams choose one and stick with it. The most common convention is:
	interfaces for objects, type aliases for everything else.
</callout-info>

In this exercise, you'll work with interfaces and their unique features.
