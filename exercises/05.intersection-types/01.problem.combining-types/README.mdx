# Combining Types

👨‍💼 Let's use intersection types to compose complex types from simpler building
blocks.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Create base types for common properties
2. Combine them with `&` to create entity types
3. Use the combined types in functions

💰 Intersection syntax:

```ts
type Combined = TypeA & TypeB & TypeC
```

🐨 Once you've completed the exercise, run `node index.ts` in the playground to test your work!
