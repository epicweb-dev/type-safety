# Intersection Types

Intersection types combine multiple types into one. A value must satisfy **all**
the combined types.

```ts
type A = { name: string }
type B = { age: number }
type C = A & B // { name: string; age: number }
```

## Intersection vs Union

- **Union (`|`)** - Value is ONE of the types
- **Intersection (`&`)** - Value is ALL of the types

```ts
type StringOrNumber = string | number // One or the other
type Named = { name: string }
type Aged = { age: number }
type Person = Named & Aged // Has both name AND age
```

## Combining Behaviors

Intersections are great for composing types:

```ts
type Timestamped = { createdAt: Date; updatedAt: Date }
type Authored = { authorId: string }

type Post = { title: string; content: string } & Timestamped & Authored
// Post has title, content, createdAt, updatedAt, AND authorId
```

## With Type Aliases

```ts
type BaseEntity = { id: string }
type User = BaseEntity & { name: string; email: string }
// User has id, name, and email
```

	Intersection types are an alternative to interface extension. They're more
	flexible because they work with any types, not just interfaces.

In this exercise, you'll use intersections to compose complex types.
