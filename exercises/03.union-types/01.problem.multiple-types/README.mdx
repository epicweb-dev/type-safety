# Multiple Types

👨‍💼 Sometimes a value can be one of several types. Union types let you express
this.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Create a type for values that can be string or number
2. Create a type for IDs that can be string or number
3. Write functions that handle union types

💰 Union type syntax:

```ts
type Either = TypeA | TypeB
```

🐨 Once you've completed the exercise, run `node index.ts` in the playground to test your work!
