# Multiple Types

👨‍💼 You've handled values that can be different types!

🦉 Notice the narrowing techniques:

- `typeof` for primitives (string, number, boolean)
- `instanceof` for class instances (Error, Date)
- Property checks for objects

TypeScript tracks what you've checked and narrows the type accordingly.
