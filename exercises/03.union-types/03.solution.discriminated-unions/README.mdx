# Discriminated Unions

👨‍💼 Perfect implementation of discriminated unions!

🦉 This pattern is extremely common in real applications:

- **API states** (loading, success, error)
- **Form states** (idle, submitting, submitted, error)
- **Authentication** (anonymous, authenticated, loading)
- **Payment methods** (card, PayPal, crypto)

The exhaustiveness check ensures you never forget to handle a case when you add
a new variant.
