# Union Types

👨‍💼 You've mastered union types and narrowing!

You learned:

- 🔀 **Union types** model "one of these types"
- 🔍 **Narrowing** with `typeof`, `in`, and type guards
- 🏷️ **Discriminated unions** with tag properties
- ✅ **Exhaustiveness checking** to handle all cases

🦉 Discriminated unions are incredibly powerful:

```ts
type ApiResponse =
	| { status: 'loading' }
	| { status: 'success'; data: User[] }
	| { status: 'error'; error: string }

// Forces you to handle all three states!
```

This pattern is used extensively in React, Redux, and other libraries.
