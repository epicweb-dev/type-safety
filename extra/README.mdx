# Extras

👨‍💼 These extras are here to help you _practice_ what you have already learned
in the workshop. They are small, practical projects that keep the focus on the
TypeScript type safety concepts: type aliases, interfaces, unions, generics,
and more.

📜 There are **no solutions** and **no tests** in this section. That is
intentional. This is about exploring, practicing, and building confidence by
applying workshop concepts to something that feels real.

🤔 You may see code that looks unfamiliar (React, Vite, styling, etc.). Feel
free to explore it, but you do not need to master it right now. Focus on the
areas with 🐨 instructions. Those are the parts that line up with what you've
learned so far.

🧠 **Spaced repetition** helps you remember what you learn by revisiting it over
time. Practical extras like these give you lots of reps and quick wins, which
makes the concepts stick and builds momentum.
