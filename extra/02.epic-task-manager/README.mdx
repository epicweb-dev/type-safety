# Epic Task Manager

👨‍💼 Welcome to the Epic Task Manager! This is a real-world React application where you'll practice all the TypeScript skills you've learned in this workshop. You'll implement utility functions that power a task management dashboard.

## What You'll Build

This app helps teams manage projects and tasks. You'll implement:

- **Type definitions** for projects, tasks, and users
- **Discriminated unions** for project status tracking
- **Generic functions** for filtering and updating tasks
- **Type narrowing** for handling user roles and assignments
- **Union types** for priorities and user roles

## Getting Started

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="src/utils.ts" /> and implement all the type definitions and utility functions. Each function has 🐨 instructions explaining what to do.

🐨 Then open <InlineFile file="src/app.tsx" /> and use your utility functions to make the app fully functional. Look for 🐨 comments indicating where to use your functions.

## Running the App

```sh
npm run dev
```

The app will start on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).

## What to Implement

### In `utils.ts`:

1. **Type Definitions** - Create discriminated unions, type aliases, and interfaces
2. **formatProjectStatus** - Handle different project status variants
3. **filterByPriority** - Generic function to filter by priority
4. **getUserDisplayName** - Handle null user values
5. **canManageTasks** - Narrow user roles
6. **updateTaskProperty** - Generic function with keyof constraints
7. **getTasksByAssignee** - Handle null and string assignee IDs
8. **createProjectUpdate** - Transition between project statuses

### In `app.tsx`:

1. Use `filterByPriority` to filter tasks
2. Use `getTasksByAssignee` to filter by assignee
3. Use `formatProjectStatus` to display project status
4. Use `updateTaskProperty` to toggle task completion
5. Use `createProjectUpdate` to transition project statuses

## Tips

💰 Start with the type definitions - they'll help TypeScript guide you as you implement the functions.

💰 Use type narrowing (typeof, instanceof, or discriminated unions) to handle different cases safely.

💰 Generic constraints ensure your functions work with any type that has the required properties.

💰 Discriminated unions make it easy to handle different variants of a type safely.

## No Tests, No Solutions

📝 This is practice time! There are no tests or solutions. Experiment, make mistakes, and learn. The goal is to build confidence by applying what you've learned.
